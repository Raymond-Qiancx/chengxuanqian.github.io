  title={A Novel Noisy Label Adaption Refinement Framework for Medical Image Segmentation},

  abstract={Although deep learning has achieved impressive results in various medical image analysis tasks, training an effective deep model requires a substantial amount of high-quality labeled data. This requirement limits its practical application. In contrast, acquiring data with noisy labels is relatively straightforward. However, directly using such data in model training can mislead the training process and degrade performance further. Efficiently utilizing noisy labeled data remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we introduce a Noisy Label Adaptive Refinement Framework based on the Mean Teacher approach for medical image segmentation. Specifically, we develop a noisy label adaptive refinement algorithm that improves noisy labels by assessing the differences among various perturbed versions. Additionally, we propose a label selection algorithm that evaluates the overall confidence of each noisy label sample within a mini-batch, selecting high-confidence samples for network updates. Extensive experiments on two public datasets have confirmed the effectiveness of each component of our framework. Moreover, our approach has demonstrated competitive results compared to other methods for handling noisy labels, efficiently processing noisy data while enhancing the model's robustness to noise.},
